# iPSC Differentiation Predictor

This project simulates and models induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation outcomes based on experimental inputs. It aims to predict quality control metrics like Purity, Viability, and Yield using protocol variables and gene expression markers.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `01_data_generation.ipynb`: Simulates a realistic iPSC differentiation dataset.
- `02_eda.ipynb`: Explores variable distributions, correlations, and biological relevance.
- `03_modeling.ipynb`: (To be added) Train ML models to predict differentiation outcomes.
- `04_dashboard.py`: (To be added) Streamlit app for protocol input and outcome prediction.

## 📊 Features

- Synthetic dataset generation based on biological assumptions
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with domain insights
- Pearson correlation with statistical significance
- Modular notebooks with step-wise documentation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy)
3. Run notebooks in order: `01_` → `02_` → `03_`

## 🧬 Motivation

Inspired by the protocol optimization goals of companies like Trailhead Biosystems, this project shows how data science can help design better stem cell experiments.
