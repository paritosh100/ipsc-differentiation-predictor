# iPSC Differentiation Predictor

This project is a science-meets-data exploration aimed at improving how we grow stem cells in the lab.

## 🧬 What Is This About?

Scientists grow stem cells (specifically iPSCs — induced pluripotent stem cells) in the lab to turn them into different types of tissues — like neurons, liver cells, or heart cells. But getting the best quality cells depends on *how* you grow them: which proteins you add, how much oxygen is in the dish, how many cells you start with, and more.

This project builds a simulation of those lab conditions and uses data science to figure out:

- What makes some cell batches healthier than others?
- Which combinations of lab conditions give the best results?
- Can we predict the success of an experiment before it happens?

## 📊 What Did We Build?

- A **simulated dataset** based on real-world biology
- Tools to **analyze patterns** in how stem cells grow
- A plan for using **machine learning** to predict and improve future experiments

Even though the data is synthetic (not from a real lab), it's based on real scientific principles — so it's a safe way to test ideas.

## 👩‍💻 What's Inside?

- **01_data_generation.ipynb** — creates mock data based on biology
- **02_eda.ipynb** — explores how lab inputs affect outcomes
- **03_modeling.ipynb** — (coming soon) predicts stem cell quality
- **04_dashboard.py** — (coming soon) an app to test your own lab recipes

## 🎯 Why Does It Matter?

This project shows how data can help scientists:
- Save time and money in experiments
- Make better decisions about lab protocols
- Bring stem cell therapies to patients faster

It’s inspired by real biotech companies working at the edge of biology and AI.
